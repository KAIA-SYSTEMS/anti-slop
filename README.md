# Kaia anti-slop

Kaia Systems' maintained fork of
[dmmulroy/anti-slop](https://github.com/dmmulroy/anti-slop).

Opinionated Oxlint rules that reject low-evidence and low-signal TypeScript and JavaScript patterns.

This project is meant to be vendored, not treated as a fixed npm dependency. Copy the rules into your repository, read them, and change them to match your team's standards. The bundled agent skill handles the initial copy and configuration; after that, the vendored files are yours to maintain and make your own.

The Kaia ruleset enables all rules. It narrows a few upstream checks to keep them
high-signal: exact object contracts and dynamic dictionary accumulators preserve
evidence, runtime `typeof` is rejected specifically for explicitly `unknown`
inputs, `shape` is checked in declarations under our control rather than external
member names, and unavoidable raw `unknown` parameters require a substantive
nearby `BOUNDARY:` comment.

## Install with an agent skill

```bash
npx skills add KAIA-SYSTEMS/anti-slop --skill install-anti-slop
```

Then ask your coding agent to install or configure anti-slop in the current repository. The skill copies the plugin, installs current Oxlint dependencies, merges the plugin into the existing lint configuration, enables every rule, and validates the result.

To inspect available skills first:

```bash
npx skills add KAIA-SYSTEMS/anti-slop --list
```

## Manual local installation

Copy `src/` into the target repository, for example at `tools/oxlint/anti-slop/`, and install matching current versions of `oxlint` and `@oxlint/plugins`.

Register the copied entry point in `oxlint.config.ts`:

```ts
import { defineConfig } from "oxlint";

export default defineConfig({
  jsPlugins: [
    { name: "anti-slop", specifier: "./tools/oxlint/anti-slop/index.ts" },
  ],
  rules: {
    "anti-slop/no-chained-type-assertions": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-conditional-empty-object-spread": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-known-value-widening": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-module-mocking": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-object-parameters": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-reflect-apply": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-reflect-get": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-runtime-typeof": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-shape-in-symbol-names": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-unknown-parameters": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-unknown-returns": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-unknown-type-aliases": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-unsafe-dictionary-type": "error",
    "anti-slop/no-widen-then-assert": "error",
    "anti-slop/require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion": "error"
  }
});
```

The same `jsPlugins` entry and rules work under `lint` in a Vite+ config.

## Rules

- `no-chained-type-assertions` — rejects nested type assertions that fabricate evidence.
- `no-conditional-empty-object-spread` — rejects conditional spreads that use `{}` to omit fields.
- `no-known-value-widening` — rejects known values widened to `unknown`, `object`, or open dictionaries while permitting exact object contracts and genuinely dynamic dictionary accumulators.
- `no-module-mocking` — rejects Vitest and Jest module mocks in favor of real dependency seams.
- `no-object-parameters` — rejects the broad `object` type on function inputs.
- `no-reflect-apply` — rejects `Reflect.apply` in favor of typed function calls.
- `no-reflect-get` — rejects `Reflect.get` in favor of typed property access or boundary parsing.
- `no-runtime-typeof` — requires schema decoding instead of ad hoc `typeof` narrowing for explicitly `unknown` values; typed-union branching and feature detection remain valid.
- `no-shape-in-symbol-names` — rejects `shape` in locally controlled declaration names without banning external member access such as `schema.shape`.
- `no-unknown-parameters` — rejects `unknown` inputs unless a nearby `BOUNDARY:` comment names the unavoidable raw source and callers decode it immediately.
- `no-unknown-returns` — rejects function contracts that return `unknown` or `Promise<unknown>`.
- `no-unknown-type-aliases` — rejects aliases that merely conceal `unknown`.
- `no-unsafe-dictionary-type` — rejects dictionary value contracts based on `unknown`, `any`, `object`, `{}`, and semantic equivalents.
- `no-widen-then-assert` — rejects local flows that widen known values and later assert them back.
- `require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion` — requires each non-const assertion to document its checked invariant.

## Violation examples

Each snippet below is rejected by the named rule.

### `no-chained-type-assertions`

```ts
const user = input as object as User;
```

### `no-conditional-empty-object-spread`

```ts
const options = {
  ...(timeout !== undefined ? { timeout } : {}),
};
```

### `no-known-value-widening`

```ts
const handlers: Record<string, Handler> = {
  start: startHandler,
};
```

This discards the known `start` key. Preserve inference or use `satisfies Record<string, Handler>` instead.

A genuinely dynamic accumulator remains valid:

```ts
const handlers: Record<string, Handler> = {};
handlers[name] = handler;
```

### `no-module-mocking`

```ts
vi.mock("./user-store");
```

### `no-object-parameters`

```ts
function save(value: object) {}
```

### `no-reflect-apply`

```ts
const value = Reflect.apply(operation, owner, args);
```

### `no-reflect-get`

```ts
const value = Reflect.get(owner, key);
```

### `no-runtime-typeof`

```ts
function decode(input: unknown) {
  if (typeof input === "string") {
    useName(input);
  }
}
```

Decode the boundary with a schema instead. `typeof` over a typed union and
feature detection such as `typeof Headers !== "undefined"` remain valid.

### `no-shape-in-symbol-names`

```ts
interface UserShape {
  id: string;
}
```

### `no-unknown-parameters`

```ts
function handle(input: unknown) {}
```

When a framework or external protocol makes `unknown` unavoidable, document the
source and decode immediately:

```ts
// BOUNDARY: message is raw JSON supplied by the WebSocket peer.
function handle(message: unknown) {
  return Schema.decodeUnknownSync(MessageSchema)(message);
}
```

### `no-unknown-returns`

```ts
function loadUser(): unknown {
  return input;
}
```

### `no-unknown-type-aliases`

```ts
type ExternalValue = unknown;
```

### `no-unsafe-dictionary-type`

```ts
type Metadata = Record<string, unknown>;
type OtherMetadata = { [key: string]: object };
```

### `no-widen-then-assert`

```ts
const loaded: User = loadUser();
const stored: unknown = loaded;
const user = stored as User;
```

### `require-safety-comment-for-type-assertion`

```ts
const userId = value as UserId;
```

Add a specific justification immediately before a necessary assertion:

```ts
// SAFETY: parseUserId validated the identifier before branding it.
const userId = value as UserId;
```

This rule covers TypeScript `as Type` assertions and angle-bracket assertions.
It does not cover `as const`, `satisfies`, ordinary type annotations, or
non-null (`!`) assertions.

## Development

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm check
```

`src/` is canonical. After changing production source, run `pnpm sync:skill-assets`; CI checks that the skill's bundled copy remains identical.
